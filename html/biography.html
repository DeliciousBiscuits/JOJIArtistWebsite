				<br/><h3> This is about him </h3><br />
				<!--the known life of the artist-->
				<p>George Miller (born 18 September 1992), better known by his stage name Joji, is a Japanese entertainer,
				   	singer, songwriter, rapper, record producer and former YouTube personality.
					Miller's start as an entertainer began on his now defunct YouTube channel, TVFilthyFrank, 
					that consisted of rap songs, rants, extreme challenges, ukulele performances and a bizarre show, with most of
					the main characters played by Miller including the titular character of Filthy Frank. Miller also produced comedy 
					hip hop music under the name Pink Guy, with his discography spanning two full-length projects and an extended play. 
					Miller's videos had widespread impact including starting a viral dance craze known as the Harlem Shake, 
					which was directly responsible for the debut of Baauer's "Harlem Shake" song atop the Billboard Hot 100.
					In late 2017, Miller retired the channel to focus on his music career, under the name Joji, 
					producing more nuanced and serious music, releasing the EP In Tongues, which peaked at number 58 on the 
					Billboard 200 and his debut studio album Ballads 1, which reached number 1 on Billboard's top R&B and 
					hip-hop chart in November 2018. With this, Miller became the first Asian artist to do so. 
					Miller's music has been described as a mix between R&B and trip hop.

					George Miller was born on 18 September 1992, in Osaka, Japan. He attended international school, 
					Canadian Academy, in Kobe, Japan, where he graduated in 2012. Not much is known about his personal life, 
					as he attempts to maintain his privacy, such as in his now deleted video "Filthy Frank Exposes Himself?" 
					where he reveals that he is a college student in Brooklyn, New York and that he does not want to reveal
					personal information, for fear of not being able to get a job later on due to the nature of his show. 
					Miller is half-Australian.
